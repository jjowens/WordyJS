# WordyJS
A Javascript module to maniplate text and checks the number of characters.

This is the Javascript version of my CSharp library, Wordy. It won't have all of the equivalent functions in this verison.

You can do the following

* Change text back to front - Example - 'A fox jumped over the brown fence' changes to 'fence brown the over jumped fox A'
* Reverse Words in text - Example - 'A fox jumped over the brown fence' changes to 'ecnef nworb eht revo depmuj xof A'
* Reverse Text - Example 'A fox jumped over the brown fence' changes to 'ecnef nworb eht revo depmuj xof A'
* Count Words - It counts how many words in your paragraph. Example it will check the string 'A fox jumped over the brown fence' and return 7.
* GetLength - It counts the length of your string
* Count Letters - It counts how many characters in your paragraph. It will ignore all whitespaces.  Example it will check the string 'A fox jumped over the brown fence' and return 27
* ContainsVowels - Will return true if it has any vowels.
* ContainsVowels - Will return true if it finds any voewles in a string
* SortText - It will split your string into an array, which is then sorted in ascending order. There may be a possiblity of duplicates
